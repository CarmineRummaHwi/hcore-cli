**hcore/cli** utilizes [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) to manage its
dependencies. So, before using HCore/CLI, make sure you have Composer
installed on your machine.

First, download the HCore/CLI using Composer:

``` {.language-php}
composer global require hcore/cli
```

Make sure to place Composer's system-wide vendor bin directory in your
`$PATH`{.language-php} so the HCORE executable can be located by your
system. This directory exists in different locations based on your
operating system; however, some common locations include:

-   macOS and GNU / Linux Distributions:
    `$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin`
-   Windows:
    `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Composer\vendor\bin`

> on some windows computers the global composer folder may be different.
You can query Composer to find where it has set the user $COMPOSER_HOME directory
by running this command:
```php
composer global config home 
```

At the end of the execution the project structure will be created.

##### require-dev
The command after creating the composer.json launches the "composer install" without the require-devs.
To include these add the "-d, --dev" option

##### generate only composer.json without install
if you want the command to generate only the composer.json file
add the "-j, --json" option.



## [Modules](#modules)

you can remove a module after installation using the command:

    hcore module:remove <module_name>

Example:
    
    hcore module:remove dmr
    hcore module:remove uploader
    

## [Widget Override](#widgetoverride)

to override a widget use the command:

    hcore widget:create <module/widget>

where "module/widget" is the widget path.
For Example if you want to override the login widget launch:
    
    hcore widget:create auth/login

if only the module is specified all the module widgets will be overwritten
    
    hcore widget:create auth
